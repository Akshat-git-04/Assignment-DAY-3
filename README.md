# JS Utility Library – Day 3 Assignment

This project contains a collection of core JavaScript utilities and mini assignments, implemented from scratch using ES6+ features.

## Features

- **debounce(func, delay)** – Delays function execution
- **throttle(func, delay)** – Limits function execution rate
- **deepClone(obj)** – Recursively clones objects
- **deepMerge(target, source)** – Deep merges two objects
- **curry(fn)** – Converts a function into curried form
- **EventEmitter** – Custom event system (on/emit/off)
- **Promise Chain** – Runs async tasks sequentially
- **Custom map/filter/reduce** – Manual array method polyfills
- **Type Checkers** – Runtime type utilities (isString, isArray, etc.)
- **LocalStorageManager** – Typed wrapper around `localStorage`

## Goal
Strengthen core JS concepts, ES6+ syntax, async programming, and modular coding patterns.
